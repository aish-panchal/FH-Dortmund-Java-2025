Problem 1 - Girsy Guzm√°n Garcia:

The code calculates the volumes of the Earth and Sun in cubic miles, assuming they're spheres (V=(4*pi*r^3)/3), as well as the ratio
of the Sun's volume to the Earth's. This solution utilized the following methods in the Math class: Math.PI (for the value of pi), 
Math.pow(a,b) to raise the radius to the power of 3, and Math.floor() to round the ratio.

Output of the solution code:
```
The volume of the Earth is 2.2984729611703882E11 cubic miles, the volume of the sun is 3.388807851993121E17 cubic miles,
 and the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth is 1474373 
```
