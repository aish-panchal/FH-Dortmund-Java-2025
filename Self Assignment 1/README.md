Problem 1 - Girsy Guzm√°n Garcia:

The code calculates the volumes of the Earth and Sun in cubic miles, assuming they're spheres (V=(4*pi*r^3)/3), as well as the ratio
of the Sun's volume to the Earth's. This solution utilized the following methods in the Math class: Math.PI (for the value of pi), 
Math.pow(a,b) to raise the radius to the power of 3, and Math.floor() to round the ratio.

Output of the solution code:
```
The volume of the Earth is 2.2984729611703882E11 cubic miles, the volume of the sun is 3.388807851993121E17 cubic miles,
 and the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth is 1474373 
```

Problem 2 - Abdelrahman Abdin Mousa

The code tests whether a number is prime or not by testing up to the square root of the number, it uses a labeled continue, and doesn't use a boolean flag for the internal loop/flow control

Output of the solution code for the test number 47 (this is a prime number): 

```
47 is prime
```

Problem 3 - Aishwary Panchal:

The code finds the number of letters, vowels, and whitespaces in the given string to calculate and output the vowels, consonants, and whitespaces in the string. 

Output of the solution code for the provided string:

```
The text contained vowels: 60
consonants: 93
spaces: 37
```

Problem 4 - Abdelrahman Abdin Mousa

The code splits the string into words, words being defined as any sequence of alphabetical characters, after splitting the string on spaces, the words are cleaned (non-alphabetical characters removed) and then the list of words is sorted using a simple bubble sort (ignoring the case of the words for sorting)

Output of the solution code for the provided string:

```
