For Homework Assignment 1, the division of the work was done as follows: 

1. Creation of the Task management system - Girzy Guzman
2. Creation of Storage management system - Abdel Rehman
3. Creation of file operations - Aishwary Panchal


This is the first part of working towards the capstone project: 

1. The task management system is responsible for almost each operation taking place in the warehouse. It manages the orders, charging stations operations and movement of vehicles.

2. The storage management system is responsible for the storage of not only our equipment i.e. the AVGs but also of the raw materials that will be used for the products.

3. The file operations class is responsible for all file operations with respect to the log files in our system. It handles creation, moving, archiving, deletion as well as opening the log files based on regex. (functionality might change to account for interaction with visual interface)
