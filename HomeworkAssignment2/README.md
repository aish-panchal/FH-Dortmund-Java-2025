For Homework Assignment 2, the division of the work was done as follows: 

1. Creation of Exception handling class - Girsy Guzman and Aishwary Panchal
2. Creation of the unit tests for our respective classes was done by all of 
us i.e. Girsy Guzman, Abdel Rehman, adn Aishwary Panchal.

This is the second part of the capstone project where a majority of the work and 
time was spent on the creation of the testing frameworks. We created our individual 
test cases in Junit and once it was ready, it was combined in a test suite where 
all test cases passed and here is the screenshot of the results of the test suite:
